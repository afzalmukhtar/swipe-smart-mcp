### 1. Copyright Assignment

You **assign all copyright and intellectual property rights** in your contribution to **Afzal Mukhtar** (the project owner).

### 2. License Back to You

In exchange, **Afzal Mukhtar** grants you a **permanent, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, modify, and distribute your own contribution as you see fit, including in other projects.

### 3. Your Representations

By contributing, you represent that:
- You are the original author of the contribution
- You have the legal right to assign the copyright

### 4. Why This Matters
